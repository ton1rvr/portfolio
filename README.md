## Projects üìä

### Introduction

This repository contains a collection of projects that demonstrate my expertise in data science, machine learning, and data visualization. Each project focuses on solving a real-world problem, showcasing my ability to handle complex datasets, develop predictive models, and generate meaningful insights. 
Below, you will find an overview of each project.

### Project 1. [Heart Attack Prediction Project](https://github.com/ton1rvr/portfolio/tree/07d5fa29fe8bedf42a502b5657f44f53c12fa21a/Project%201%20-%20Heart%20Attack%20Prediction%20(ML%20w%3A%20python))

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/telecom.jpg"> 

**Overview** : This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of a heart attack based on health indicators such as age, cholesterol levels, and maximum heart rate. I used a variety of machine learning techniques including PCA, LDA, and SVM to analyze the data and develop predictive models.

**Key Insights**: The non-linear SVM model achieved the highest accuracy at 92.1%, demonstrating its effectiveness in medical diagnostics. Neural networks also showed potential, though they posed a risk of overfitting.

**Visual Summary**: The project includes visualizations like scatter plots, PCA variance analysis, and SVM decision boundaries, providing a clear picture of model performance and feature importance.

### Project 2. [SMS Spam Filter Project](https://github.com/ton1rvr/portfolio/tree/07d5fa29fe8bedf42a502b5657f44f53c12fa21a/Project%202%20-%20SMS%20Spam%20Filter%20(NLP%20w%3A%20python))

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/telecom.jpg"> 

**Overview:** This project aims to build an SMS spam filter using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. The dataset comprised 5,572 SMS messages, and I employed methods such as TF-IDF vectorization and Naive Bayes classification to identify spam.

**Key Insights:** The Naive Bayes classifier proved to be the most efficient, balancing speed and accuracy, with strong performance metrics like a high F1-score for spam detection.

**Visual Summary:** Visualizations include word clouds for common terms and confusion matrices, effectively illustrating the model's ability to differentiate between spam and non-spam messages.

### Project 3. [NBA Salary Prediction Using Multiple Regression](https://github.com/ton1rvr/portfolio/tree/07d5fa29fe8bedf42a502b5657f44f53c12fa21a/Project%203%20-%20NBA%20Salary%20Prediction%20(Multiple%20Reg%20w%3A%20R))

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/telecom.jpg"> 

**Overview:** The goal of this project is to predict NBA player salaries using performance metrics like Points Per Game (PPG) and Assists Per Game (APG). Various regression models, including Ridge and Lasso, were applied to determine the best predictors.

**Key Insights:** Ridge Regression emerged as the most reliable model, offering the best balance between bias and variance, with key predictors like PPG and player experience identified as significant.

**Visual Summary:** The project features scatter plots and regression coefficient charts, highlighting the relationship between player performance and salaries.

### Project 4. [COVID-19 Vaccination and Impact Analysis](https://github.com/ton1rvr/portfolio/tree/07d5fa29fe8bedf42a502b5657f44f53c12fa21a/Project%204%20-%20COVID-19%20Analysis%20(data%20viz%20w%3A%20python))

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/telecom.jpg"> 

**Overview:** This project analyzes global vaccination trends and their impact on COVID-19 case reductions. Using data from Our World in Data, I explored correlations between vaccination rates and health outcomes across different regions.

**Key Insights:** A strong correlation was found between higher vaccination rates and a decrease in COVID-19 cases, though significant disparities in vaccination coverage were noted across regions.

**Visual Summary:** The analysis is supported by time series plots, scatter plots, and choropleth maps, which visually depict vaccination efforts and their effects globally.

### Project 5. [Stock Market Analysis Using Yahoo Finance API](https://github.com/ton1rvr/portfolio/tree/07d5fa29fe8bedf42a502b5657f44f53c12fa21a/Project%205%20-%20Stock%20Market%20Analysis%20(YFinance%20API%20w%3A%20python))

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src="https://github.com/archd3sai/Portfolio/blob/master/Images/telecom.jpg"> 

**Overview:** In this project, I analyzed stock performance over time, using both technical indicators like Moving Averages and RSI, and fundamental analysis through financial ratios. The data was sourced via the Yahoo Finance API.

**Key Insights:** The analysis identified optimal trading strategies and assessed the financial stability of companies like Apple, highlighting the importance of a balanced approach using both technical and fundamental data.

**Visual Summary:** The project includes price trend charts, volume analysis, and interactive comparisons, providing a comprehensive view of stock performance and investment potential.
